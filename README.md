Application of data mining tools ( RapidMiner and R-Studio) and machine learning techniques to solve real life business problems

I performed a variety of task as a data analys for Blackwell Electronic (simulated company). I utilized data mining and
machine-learning techniques to investigate the patterns in customer sales data and provided insight
into customer buying trends and preferences. The inferences drawn from  analysis was then used to assist management
to make data-driven decision about sales and marketing activities of products for customers.

Understanding customer and purchasing behavior, segmenting customers by demographic factors, determining products to
market, predicting profitibality, and sale of products were several several objective completed in this project.
